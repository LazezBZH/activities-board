## Overview

### The challenge

- Your challenge is to build out this dashboard and get it looking as close to the design as possible.
- You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.
- If you would like to practice working with JSON data, we provide a local data.json file for the activities. This means you'll be able to pull the data from there instead of using the content in the .html file.
- Your users should be able to:
  - View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
  - See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
  - Switch between viewing Daily, Weekly, and Monthly stats

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup in jsx
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- mobile first
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)

### What I learned

- Add an error boundary.
- Interraction with Clipboard.
- Create a pseudo auth (just in the js front so easily hackable but that was not my main goal ).
- I tried to be as rigorous as possible with responsive level, I coded in mobile first.

### Useful resources
